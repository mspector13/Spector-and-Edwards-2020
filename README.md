Important:

Data management is *not* a skill often taught to early career scientists. I have done my best to include the code and the data that were used for analysis and to generate the figures associated with this manuscript. Dr. Luke Miller generously donated his time to helping fit P vs I data to this model, adapted from Webb et al. 1974 (as we did not conduct "traditional" P vs I curves). 

Any and all correspondences, including but not limited to criticism, critiques, and questions, should be addressed to mspector.ecology@gmail.com
